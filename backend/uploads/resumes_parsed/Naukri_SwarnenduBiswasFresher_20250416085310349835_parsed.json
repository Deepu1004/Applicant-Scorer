    "experience": "Research Intern\nDecember 2022 - March 2023\nUnder the guidance of Prof A.K. Deb, IIT Kharagpur • Deployed an inverted pendulum system using OpenAI’s gym environment • Implemented a deep Q-learning algorithm to make sure the pendulum stays balanced after it is disturbed • Created an animation for the system using Matplotlib showing a cart and pendulum along with plots for different\nparameters against time",
